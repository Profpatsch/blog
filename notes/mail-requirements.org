* Workflow
** Reading Mail
   Important Mail should be sorted to the top automatically.
   => That means priority filtering needs to happen
   There’s two actions, archive and delete.
   Directly queuing stuff in (external!) TODO/Calendar &c. should be possible,
   but can also happen manually.
   Seeing the context (i.e. thread or similar) of a mail should be one action.
** Finding Mail
   Threaded view should be default.
   Filtering by fulltext or arbitrary tags/fields.
   There are no folders (they don’t work), just indexing.
** Answering Mail
   Reply all is default. Recipients should be prominently listed and easy to change.

** Address book
   Should integrate into an existing contact database easily.
** Attachment
   Attachments come first. Don’t want to forget them.
